# Team Working Question Prompts

## Our principles

* We prioritise the learning of the group ahead of individual learning.
* Every member of the group should understand every part of the code.

These questions can help us stick to these principles as a team! :smile: :smile: :smile: :smile:

## When could these be used?

These questions could be asked at any point, but might be particularly helpful when a group is:

* returning from a break
* switching partners
* swapping roles
* About to do a PR

## Example questions:

:speech_balloon: "Is everyone happy that they understand the code so far?"

:speech_balloon: "Would anyone like to ask for more explanation of anything?"

:speech_balloon: "Has everyone had an equal chance to contribute?"

:speech_balloon: "If we had to present to the cohort on what our pair has been doing, would we **both** be able to explain?"

:speech_balloon: "Would we like to work through anything step-by-step together as a group?"

:speech_balloon: "Do we need to ask the other pair for help?"

:speech_balloon: "Do we need to ask a mentor for help?"
